ForceField allows you to create and simulate virtual objects, textures, and forces in your desktop environment.\n\nThe project was *super successful* and we ended up **winning the Frederick Ketterer Memorial Award for outstanding creativity in Engineering Design** as well as 4th place overall in the school of engineering. Tyler and Preston did the majority of the mechanical engineering, Colin did the computer-side software, and **I took lead on the electrical engineering aspects as well as the microcontroller-side software.**\n\nFor more information or access to any of the design files, shoot me an email at davvidbaker@gmail.com, and I'd be happy to share.
