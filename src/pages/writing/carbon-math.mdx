# Carbon Math

The numbers around carbon can be confusing and misleading. I'll attempt to untangle some things that have tripped me up.

## 416 ppm
Carbon Dioxide ppm according to NOAA in 2022

## Carbon vs CO<sub>2</sub>
If I say there are 300

2400 Â± 240 GtCO<sub>2</sub> cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions since the start of the industrial age (1850-2019, according to IPCC) 

Atomic mass of Carbon: 12 amu 12The atomic mass of carbon is 12, while the atomic mass of CO2 is 44. Therefore, to convert from gigatonnes carbon to gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, you simply multiply 44 over 12. In other words, 1 gigatonne of carbon equals 3.67 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide.

Atomic mass of CO<sub>2</sub>: 44 amu
