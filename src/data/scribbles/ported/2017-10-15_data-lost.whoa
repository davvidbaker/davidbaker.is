Every once in a while I forget on what level I am building this thing. This whoa thing I mean. I think I am narrowing down its scope. 🕵{What ever am I saying!?}

|- Gosh tangents are so cool. I wish I used them more. It sucks that they have to be so short as is. -|

🔎Paradise Lost🔍

Wow I really had no idea what that was about.

Oh yes because to Data Lost.

What was I thinking it was...

A short story of the quick downward spiral into a pit of depression a man experiences after losing something vital (irreplaceable) on his laptop. 

### What would be that vital that he couldn't think of it again?

*I must stop myself from these thoughts of "Oh I should just transfer this to Gatsby."*. But then again, it would also be kinda nice in some ways.

|- There's oh so many cool things about a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc. -|
