Real quick I just wanted to take a snapshot of this phone component I made over the past couple days.

One thing I am realizing is that I wish I could just use `.whoa` syntax anywhere I wanted to. Would it be too distracting for straight up writing to be amongst the weeds of a javascript file?

That way I could have more control over componentsâ€”total control of the DOMâ€”within a post.

In fact, with Web Components, I might be able to do literally everything from the browser. 

Hmmm. Maybe not... Going backwards from editing a component to a source file might be tricky, so I think I would run into some intermediary(?) problems.

Like I'm not sure if I'd be able to edit components **AND** retain state. ðŸ˜².

# This post really went nowhere and I probably should redact most of it.

Oh also I thought about writing this earlier, but then forgot, and am now questioning its ðŸ•µ{consequences}.

## I see ðŸ•µ{signs} all the time. 

Those ðŸ•µ{signs} are usually ðŸ•µ{telling} me ðŸ•µ{to smoke more weed}.
