🕵{This should never be published.}

I have been getting extremely stressed out the past few days. My mind is just running all up and around and shit.

# 🕵{Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.}

That's how I feel.

Maybe I'm just in a funk. Why am I getting so {mad, frustrated}(?), so easily? |- Okay okay okay. -|

It's like, I want to do something, but then I make some progress but not in a way that I am actually happy with 😡😠😡.

# ARGHGHGHHG 😲

The astonished face emoji looks way doper on Samsung.

I should come back to this.

# The past couple weeks, I've been an iOS developer.

## Here's some quick thoughts from someone who usually deals with the web platform.

The autocomplete that comes with a typed language is super nice.

I've been using Swift (3.1), which I have found much more reader-friendly (and auto-complete friendly) than Objective-C.

Xcode seems to always be analyzing your code and finding any potential errors, before even trying to build.

## UGHHH getting tired 😞.

Oh yes, really quick and totally unrelated. [Making this animation library thing is what I was talking about frustrating me so](/static/blog/domomatopoeia.html). That is just a snapshot. I am not going to ever update that file.

I'm actually not that unhappy with how it is going. It will maybe one day be the full-fledged animation library I have in mind. It's not using any external libraries. Pure HTML, Javascript and CSS. 

# The dream.
