Quick thought. Write on here more often. |-I wonder how many times I have basically written that sentence right theyar.-|

# Fuck.

It's 6:19 in the morning. And I'm saying I should write more. That is just not a good idea right now.

Tomorrow (Sunday) I should do two things. I should make *normatives* work inside of whoa-loader. I need to stop thinking of whoa-loader being used by others―but I *do* still want to be able to use it and maintain it in the future. I should get the rest of Box Man back up and running. I got it to functional, but haven't implemented some basic stuff like using Box Man's camera himself, or sending textual messages.

Here's a third thing I should do. Maybe. ~~I should maybe add the normatives to my trello Immediate board. No probably not, actually.~~

## I should also look into using Github flavored Markdown instead of this measly ol' classic Markdown markup 😉.

The wink is because classic Markdown is really great. Github has improved an already great tool. Let's look at Markdown's history.

Hmmm. Maybe using emoji could be a way to wrap stuff...but I don't want to limit my potential use(?) of emoji...

**Now that I am really looking at this project from a decent perspective, I am really liking it 😁!** Just looking at the input and the output is really pretty cool. Everything else can be a black box for all I care ◼.

Links aren't working. Neither are images? I need to fix those things.
