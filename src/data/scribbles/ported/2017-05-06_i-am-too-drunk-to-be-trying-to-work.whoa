Yet again I am getting caught up in the theme settings! 

## Ahhh😮😐😮😐😮😐😮😐😮😐😮😐😮😐😮😐😉

# I would really like to get time travel working tomorrow in .whoa.
By tomorrow I meant this weekend.

I'd also like to set up some CD and get Tangents to meander more, staying within page limits.

And the flash of the page is still driving me nuts. So I gotta get thaaat done.

I'm not writing about anything interesting at allll. I am just writing abuot fine details of what I am kinda thinking about and not giving good context, nor showing any pace. Time travel should help fix the pacing problem ⏲. Not time travel, that'll only help in development. **Really what I mean is more animated coming on of text.** But I am not totally sure how I feel about animations that are not triggered by a user action.

# What about line numbers like scripture?

I guess many types of literary things have line numbers in the margins. Poetic stuff, right?
