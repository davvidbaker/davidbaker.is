*I'm amazed there is no waffle emoji.*

I just had one of those 🕵{edible stroopwaffles}. All str🕵{oopwaffle}s are 🕵{edible} (hopefully!), but you know what I mean.

*Stop the music,* he said.

# In order for someone to buy in to your alternate experience, you need to captivate them immediately.

*felt profound at the moment*

I should add comments to moving through time and space. I should add some patterns for normatives to grab on to. I would rather have written "I need to add comments to moving through time and space." write there.

Service worker as a database. Is that at all an interesting idea. Don't think so.

I bet [wooorm](https://github.com/wooorm) has an interesting blog. He's at least got [a fun website](http://wooorm.com).

# Whoa.
## I just for the first time was able to see `whoa` parsing and transforming in real time in the browser of this [moving-through-time-and-space](./moving-through-space-and-time) page.

Damn I'm really getting 🕵{very little} accomplished. Or maybe 🕵{almost not time has elapsed}?

Here's an idea. Frontend chaos(?) testing. Am I just thinking of [fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)? Hmmm...maybe overload is a better term.

I would love to just be spinning off microservices left and right at work. Maybe not exactly left and right. But occasionally. I think that is where [Chris](https://github.com/cschauer) is heading with `hive`, kinda. For that I would like to make the a super awesome dashboard for managing everything. Spinning up new hives with a nice wizard maybe.

🔎react wizard🔍

...a brief time

![./flam-screenshot.png](./flam-screenshot.png)

There's just no way to stop thinking about work sometimes.

Is [react-commander](https://github.com/davvidbaker/react-commander) a wizard?


```component
tag: Definition
props:
  word: wizard
  ipa: jərʌ wɪzəɹd ɑɪɹi
  PoS: noun
  children: a thing that walks you through a process
  style: {gridColumn: "2 / span 4"}    
```

<br />

🔎wizard🔍

<br />

Just had a good idea, I think. For custom components I want in here but don't feel like adding a `whoa` thing for, just write a good snippet with good tabbing..

Is Gütenberg kinda like [Pages](https://www.apple.com/pages/) for the web? 

What is pages like now??? Is it awesome? Like, it used to be pretty fun. I shall try it out.

...trying it out

Oh right. It's very *static*. Like things are meant to be printed. Not alive.

I would really love to get a flame chart in here right now. 

```component
tag: CycleItems
props:
  title: Maybe I'll do that tomorrow interspersed with 
  items: [
    'work.', 'work woork.', 'woooork.',
  ]
```

One-off components should also be easier to make. Like right now I am imagining a graph of 🕵{highness} over time but maybe not over time, maybe over `y` (vertical distance from the beginning of the post) as I wrote through this post. It would like something like:

<div style=

```component

  name: Me

    {
      me: true,
      value: "Yo I have some *ideas*"
    },
    {
      me: true,
      value: "### Think about how cool flambé🔥 could look on the touch bar."
    },
    {
      value: "# Cool"
    },
    {
      value: "I think"
    },
    {
      value: "..."
    },
    {
      value: "Here's an idea *I* had"
    },
      {value: "whoa could be a whole platform."},
  {value: "## BYOD"},
    {
    me: true,
    value: "of course"
  },
  {
    value: "Opinionated. Also."
  },
  {
    value: "And some of those opinions. VS Code (latest). Snippets. `whoa-theme`, probably. Also."
  },
  {
    me: true,
    value: "these could also be thought of as dependencies."
  },
  {
    value: "But dependencies should really be explicit and modularly(?) replaceable. Like... the text editor... Is it BYO? Probably should be. You might not want dictate to that level."
  }
  ]
```  
</div>

Oh yes here's a couple ideas that I should do.

- Add a notch to iPhoneX. **And design around it.**
  - This should only happen for future versions of phone though. It should be backwards compatible. I can just add a prop to choose a version of the phone and **leave the default**


  - flambé🔥 could be really cool for managing a team. Like everyone on the team could see everyone's else's charts.

  - Layers of whoa files diffed to add layers.


  Here's something I ought to do for work: 
  🔎Component Inventory🔍


Different levels of {abstraction, programming}(?)
  - snippets
  - components

I guess snippets are more of a utility or shortcut.


# Shortcut-based User Interfaces
**...where you can swap out the shortcuts between device types.**

Wait what.

🔎scroll overflow bounciness for document body🔍

[This is what I was looking for.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overscroll-behavior) Too bad you can't have the bounciness on elements beside `<body />` it seems. |-It might work on Firefox, but that ain't good enough-|

![markup](./markup.png)

I should probably switch from styled components to `[emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)` like everywhere. I'd much rather always right CSS as a string than as a `{javascript object}`.

🔎css formal syntax🔍

*Whoa.* [This is very cool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Value_definition_syntax).

Wow. I'm really all over the place right now. I need to get flamecharts in here.

# I am going to start...
...see next post

<hmm>why did I do that.</hmm>


I am going to start getting in shape. Taking care of my body. Exercising.

I want to be able to jump higher. I might try [this](https://www.basketballforcoaches.com/vertical-jump/).

Observe. Alter. Improve. O. A. I. 

*Oooh an idea* for another statistic to be added to the thing. Words per minute (typed). I guess also words per minute spoken maybe at some point, but that's less pressing. Also if I haven't already mentioned it,

I should start making improvements to `[whoa](https://whoa.now.sh)` through a test-driven approach. TDD. **Wait not exactly.** What I mean is I should just start using markup ideas that I have

Here is how opinionated whoa should be:

There's no question one of the best ways to ensure a project is maintained is to do it yourself? (Oh I remembered, much later in the evening. Depend upon it for your livelihood.)

I need a component for I forgot what I was saying midway through that sentence.

## Night and day should definitely be denoted somehow. 

And location should be taken into account. So location will also have to be tracked, somewhat.

I should also make line charts biggerable {sic}.

I need a list of components I can use just a shortcut away, and a visual click?

What I want is just 🕵{to have people following along because} they see what you are doing and are interested so they are following the story. Know what I'm saying?

I like thinking of the idea of software engineering as removing unnecessary work. Or minimizing it. Maybe? {Removing work.}

A component that indicates confidence in a statement. Like that last one would be given 50%? And this one also 50%.

I was reading about quantum computing yesterday, and it's absolutely fascinating. Maybe I go back to school for something like that. I think what I need to look at is a good concrete example of quantum computing solving a **real,** *tangible* problem. Or rather do something that normal computers just cannot do. Solving exponentially difficult e ^n.

*I need an easy superscript markup.*

If I was understanding [what I was watching](https://youtu.be/ZN0lhYU1f5Q?t=18m) correctly, which I definitely might not have been, then, if you can transform your problem into certain types of matrix multiplications/operations, you can reap the benefits that quantum computing can provide.

Though, I guess we have not yet made quantum computers with enough qubits to really be useful[needs source]. Ie there are not yet problems that can be solved faster on quantum computer than a regular one.

One of the great things about Something like Trello/Jira does is demonstrate(?) visibility of your problems. Granularize. Make your problems, or maybe priorities, very visible.

That's why I need to work on Limbo a lot more! Maybe limbo should actually be somewhere like Trello. Like you send an activity out into limbo and it is continued or whatever when that thing does a certain action. Just an easy hook-in to s

Insight.now.sh
Insight into how your organization functions at a large scale by analyzing granular actions, like communication. 

A great starting point could be looking at @mentions. 

Cycle: Who is mentioning who? Who is is responding to who. Response times. Lengths of responses. Elements used in responses. (code blocks, images, etc.) Is *more* generally better? Maybe not strictly, but more be a contributing factor to doing well, depending on how it's done.

...to depend upon it.

Visual representations of your code executing. Objects being created, calling things, etc. Data flowing throughout. Kind of as a 3d vector field. Right?

A way to debug is to look at snapshots of your data as it moves throughout its transformation.

A line plot of knowledge over time. How do you measure knowledge?

I guess you could rank our understanding of different things through time.

On a broader picture, it could be for life in general, not just humans. Like understanding ourselves is one thing. But understanding.....is it just instinct though?

I want to have some fun making informational websites for my own things.

It's really too bad flambé's frontend totally broke down today. With [lerna] needs link() issues. Might have probably had to do with something in the environment changing.

```component
tag: CycleItems
props:
  title:
  items: [
    'version of npm', 'version of node', 'version of lerna', 'webpack update', 'webpack-dev-server update', 'webpack plugin updates'
  ]
```


~~One thing I am pretty positive about though is that it wasn't a babel issue. It actually wasn't really webpack stuff either. That only cropped up at the end and seems minor.~~
Actually, now having gotten it back up again, `babel@7.0.0-beta.47` might have been a culprit somehow. So hard to pin this kind of thing down. 🤷‍♂️. Oh well.

I need npm autocomplete in my terminal. Does npx provide that? **EDIT: No, no it certainly does not. It is just sugar for `../node_modules/whatever/bin`**. Or global cache etc. I need a better EDITed presentation.

I hope it's clear to you, David, that the reason things are not being split into separate posts these days is because how not effortless that is to do.

I think I do very much like the name everything.now  

*It's called everything now. I use it for everything now*

Just a spiral up here into introspection.



The Introspective Spirals 🎸

# What is the reason I am interested in user interface?

I want us to be able to more easily control the machines. 🤖🤖🤖🤖

The problem I was alluding to earlier about 🕵{being high and thinking of ideas and being enthusiastic about them} but 🕵{being too high} to follow through with any ideas. And then enthusiasm fades with 🌲elevation.

I think I should think about doing some flag-rooted features.

I feel like watching the propogation of a new version of code 


So flambé🔥 should be the name for flame charts specifically. Not the service that is everything.now. 

Here's an idea. Accessibility modes. Or flags or sliders.

**Simple analytics**, like line plot of issue count over time. Open pull request count. Number of branches. Number of forks.
