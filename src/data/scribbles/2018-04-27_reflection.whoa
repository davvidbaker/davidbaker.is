Right now in my life, it seems that a **good week** is one that **goes quickly**. I don't like that.

Let's take a second and think about what's been going on in my life. I've been 🕵{smoking too much weed}, for one thing. I haven't really been excited about much of anything recently. I've also been 🕵{playing too many video games}. That's kinda all 🕵{my roommate Nick and} I do sometimes.

It would be cool to see some additional context in these posts, maybe. Maybe not also. I am not quite sure what that would look like. I guess what I'm thinking of is some sort of embedded 🔥 flambé 🔥 chart. Embeds is something I've been meaning to work on for a while, but first I feel like I should iron out all the auth details first. Why am I putting off auth so heavily?? It's something I should actually stop and think about, instead of just stumbling my way through, like I have been doing all too much.

Work has been 🕵{fine} I guess. It's altogether 🕵{kinda boring}, and I don't think I'm 🕵{doing a great job}. The best part has probably been improving my team-related `git` skills. 🕵{Nevertheless} I still did a 🕵{rather haphazard merge the other day}. I'm wholly unconvinced that all the `flow` typing stuff we are doing is worth our time. Maybe I should be putting more thought into that stuff. Idk. I do 🕵{play a lot of ping pong on my days} in the office. That's probably 🕵{not the kinda thing a potential employer} would want to see. Neither is a lot of the stuff on here though. 🤷‍♂️

I should listen to more music.

...Now listening to After the Storm by Mumford and Sons

I struggle to {write, think}(?) while listening to music though.

I think I'd like to start writing posts to a more completed state than I had been previously. I'd like this post to be finished tonight, is what I'm saying.

## Aneliese is having a baby any day now.

That is super exciting. And I am going home in a few days to meet the little fella. 

I am going to go read now for the first time in a long time. I think I'll jump back in to *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*. I am not so far removed from that that I'll struggle to remember what was happening. At least I hope not.
