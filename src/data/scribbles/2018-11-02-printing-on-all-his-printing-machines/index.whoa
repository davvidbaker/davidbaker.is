I'm definitely happier when I'm making things targeted at me as the end user.

```component
tag: CycleItems
props:
  title: ''
  byLine: true
  items: [
    'I am not unhappy right now. I have been stressed about work though.',
    "I'm so slaphappy right now. I have been eating pullled pork though."
  ]
```

‚ö†Ô∏èThere is a bug with the above (implementation of `byLine` in `<CycleItems />` ) that causes a jump on initial render. It's not hard to see.‚ö†Ô∏è

I really wish I spent more time exploring some of the concepts I've outlined here throughout.

üîécan a raspberry pi act as a wireless router, and if so, what would the signal strength be like?üîç

# As I go through building Box Man, one of the things I will be exploring is hot reloading multiple devices across networks (like one device is on wifi, another on cellular network) that are connected to each other P2P.

## So this will hot reloading in 'production'‚Äìor, rather,  hot reloading in public, since I can do it at a different domain (like `box-man-beta.now.sh`)

### This might turn out to be interesting.
