# whoa
    
> Totally dopesicle.

I haven't written on here in over a month it seems it seems.

I've kinda forgotten what I can do on here. 🕵{This is a thing, right?} *This is very radical.*

I was thinking some thoughts... Where did they goooo... |-I think they are gone. Gone to the ether. Alone with the wifi waves.-|
I guess I can write like this. Now we've got the best of both hwhorlds. 🌎    

Once I start writing it's like I get very tired. 🕵{Why is this? What have you done!? Who done? What the fuck am I saying}

## Why is it so hard to find my voice sometimes?

```component
tag: Phone
props:
  name: Me
  messages: [
    {
      me: true,
      value: "# Maybe it's cuz of texting"
    },
    {
      me: true,
      value: "### Probably not though"
    },
    {
      value: "It's probably just my fault"
    }
  ]
```
    

Okay. I am adding styled-components to this blog? That actually might be a bad idea, until I can totally eliminate styled-jsx code, which probably won't be easy, due to its scoping.

🔎Migrate from styled-jsx to styled-components🔍
      
### Not much in way of results.

I think it's going to be kinda annoying but doable. My reason for doing it is that some things like dynamic variables don't work great in `styled-jsx`
