*Listen to 🕵{L$D} by 🕵{A$AP Rocky} while reading this.*

I was going to write something about Elixir and the hype and how it's real. **The hype**.

What if we can see Trello actions on the timeline, and they can be associated with stitch activities, but not super coupled to Trello cards.

With stitch I think a 

I like writing, and I ~~like writing~~ write in more user interactive ways. Not interactive. More devices. Devices as in poetic devices, not **the machines**.

I was talking to a friend of mine recently about writing a book about how numbers are the enemy. 

### What the fuck could that even mean? 

Is it that numbers are the grand design and we /ɑrɪntə/ to look God in the eye? Is this what happened to Cantor?

Here's what I mean. Thinking about numbers is an interesting path into some philosophically disturbing concepts, infinity being the obvious go to. But also zero. And 1. And also 2. 3 isn't that special. The more we look at the numbers the more bizarre everything seems.

Irrationals, things like π being irrational. Things like π existing at all as a concept. There is this idea of a circle locus of points at a certain distance, and the ratio between the distance of the circumference to the diameter is an irrational number. Maybe limiting our idea of numbers to non-irrationals is holding us back. 

🔎Are irrational numbers often the sum of series?🔍

[This]([https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1466622/is-it-possible-to-represent-every-irrational-number-as-a-limit-of-an-infinite]) kind of answers a similar question .

## Ohh here's an idea!
A post could have some kind of challenge that when successfully completed allows them to unlock the redactions.

*or*

A dark take on that being premium content being redacted. That's pretty funny―redacting important words ✍️{if you are behind a paywall}.

### Another idea! 

Overlays/underlays either customizable (backgrounds) or shaders that somehow represent the project's overall status, like maybe how mature something is, eg beta.

I like how smurdgy [sic] the revise component looks now. 👇

It looks kinda like real paper that has bled some ink, which I like. I should try making one that looks like whiteout too. That might look kinda neat.

I like how the lady sitting next to me says /əskɛɹd/. I don't know why she's scared though. She's talking to her friend(?) about G-d.

If I return a negative answer to a promise, should that be a rejection? 🤔

I should right now not worry about being able to scale and instead just be get it to the point where I can share it with friends.
