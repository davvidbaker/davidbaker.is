I was just looking at [the about us ](https://callstack.com/about-us) for some company.

What would my bio be, if I had to right one write now [sic]?

> David is really into charts. Sometimes. And efficiency. And observability. He thinks visualizations are a neat way to load things into your mind hole. He gets self-conscious when writing about himself. He usually has too many tabs open at the same time.

There are times when my tab count just explodes.

...20 minutes
Well I have just failed to get snippets working.

I kinda like that idea for markup of time elapsing.
```whoa
...20 minutes
Well I have just failed to get snippets working.

```

**Oh wait I got it!!!** Not sure at all what changed just now from a few minutes ago. Buuuuut, I should cool figure out if I can get

I am having trouble keeping a train of thought right meow 🐱. |- I'm not really into cats―I mean I like them just fine, but I've never lived with one. -|

My thinking can be disjumbled [sic] sometimes.

I will occasionally look to the Chicago Style Guide to see what they prescribe, [like here for *sic*]().

Having so many windows and desktops open doesn't help.

I guess I go for Chicago Style Guide because I don't hate what I'm reading, and [a professor] I thought was wise about prescriptive pedagogy said he used it, I think. |-It would be neat to have snippets for wrapping sections. I guess just Emmet.-|

I should make it so images preload their full-res version on hover, and then clicking does the zoom FLIP animation like Medium.

To make the zoom FLIP animation, I should make a little `react-flip` module.

All these windows and tabs and applications are really eating up my memory. 🕵{Both my computer's memory and my memory of what I am really doing.}

I would really like more control over my image sizes. That should be easy enough. I should do that―also over my image resolution. |-All those screenshots are just from one machine. There's another one working together through synergy.-|

Ok. Back to that bio.

> Meet David. David has a weak sense of smell. He often fantasizes about a world run rampant with smells. He also likes words. David thrives 🕵{when he has authority and autonomy}, if it's possible to mix those things. If he wasn't here (on this about page for some company), he'd probably be somewhere else, doing something else that he wants to be doing.

### That is not a good bio. 

I think one of the reasons applying for jobs can be so draining is it really forces you try to {define, summarize}(?) yourself in a way that you just don't do all that often. I guess all the company cares about (~~mostly~~ entirely) is that you do good quality work for them. But people also like to work with people they generally like.
