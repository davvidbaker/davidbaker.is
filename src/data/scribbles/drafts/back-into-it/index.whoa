I am 🕵{getting back into} it.

## Hot Takes
- a single cli command that opens all my things back to a previous state
  - `open sesame` 👈 I feel like explaining workflow by telling someone "Then you open sesame and ..." would be pretty fun.
- I need a tab manager
- I need everything.now to be working better ― I guess mostly more feature work. But not only. It's essential UX stuff, that is keeping me from using it.
- Fix my `code` commands (for opening Visual Studio Code)
- I feel like  🕵{I am only excited about} many of 🕵{my projects when I am a} certain 🕵{level of high}.
- I need a better way to {organize, group}? windows and tabs into project-focused windows.

I like to leave behind trails 🕵{of fun} in my codebases. 🍬🍬🍬🍬🗺

I need to do more things more quickly, and then edit more things more often. More is a funny word.

... The next day...?

## I forgot to mention this yestereday [sic].

Part of why I am excited about work is finally getting to work on a real piece of software that people use regularly and rely on as one of their primary tools of the trade. I kind of get to ooown the product.

What 🕵{do people mean when they say David has} such 🕵{high earning potential}?

Is 🕵{programming} about doing things 🕵{programmatically}? What does 🕵{program} even mean?

There is a future involving web 3.0 where there can be individual's editions of the web. I can make any layered(?) changes to the web and that can be served instead of the original format. **Fake Web**

#Oh no!

I am about to go down a domain hole. Rabbit hole to the rescue! *This would be a great opportunity to have rabbit holes be embeddable.* 

potential taglines for Rabbit Hole (aka stitch aka everything.now)
  - It's dark down there.

### Wheew. Made it out. 😵

I feel like I am getting more into 🕵{virtual machines} as I {think, speak}?.

Ok. I should focus on Fourth Person / Box Man / ? now.

It would be☝️kind of cool if the backend were written with Phoenix Channels. Maybe a bit overboard? Maybe not. It's all gonna have to be measured eventually. ***Focus now!***

Can I yet use `|>` pipes in javascript yet with babel?

...Many days later...

I'd like to set a goal of writing (more).

I have a pair of glasses that I use for finding my other glasses. (exaggeration).

Fuck I've just spent over an hour just trying to make this thing work again. My writing tool I mean. Ughh. Okay now it will is just not reloading in the browser unless I restart the gatsby server.

...Many more days later...
Hot reloading is working once again!

It's *weird* how things break seemingly randomly and then somehow *magically* work again.
