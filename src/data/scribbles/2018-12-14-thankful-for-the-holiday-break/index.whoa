My company has graciously given me and my fellow employees a winter break, if you will, this holiday season. I've decided to stay out here in Denver instead of go home,and I'd like to accomplish some things that I haven't found myself able to during the course of daily life.

## Get flambÃ©ðŸ”¥ out there.

This will require lots of fixes and usability enhancements. There are many a half-baked feature in there right now. I should make use of more feature flags in settingsâ€“*experimental* settings maybe.

## Box Man

This needs to happen. There are some user-flow bugs right now, but things have been stabilizing pretty well I think. There are lots of redesign/upgrade things I want to happen around here too.
