How does google define toil?

üîéSRE toilüîç

[I'll save you a step](https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/eliminating-toil.html). Or two.

> So what is toil? Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that **scales linearly as a service grows**.

Emphasis mine.

Look at code here üëá inside *Adrift is longer than a tangent. Maybe I should rename those to be opposites though.
<Adrift>
<div class="thought">It's very easy to make a css class and style that.</div>

<style>
.thought {
  background: yellow;
}
</style>
Well that isn't working. Fuck.

In case I haven't document this. *I want to MDX work.* I mostly want the `<JSX />`
If I had an AST to manipulate, and `.whoa` files were **auto-formattable**, I think I could *trivially* do things like change the color of something in the browser and have it reflect in this here `.whoa` file. This ~~might need~~ needs to be thought out some more, it is somewhat along the lines of what the [notion](https://notion.so) editor is doing.

I think auto-formattable is maybe the only thing whoa is missing for this to already be the case.

I may have lost some writings about the beginning of debugging.
Anyways, here's {an, the}(?) idea. Flame charts to demonstrate the thought processes.

```
Google Home not responding
  Say Hey Google multiple times /x/ Check that the device is plugged in. This is basically check for power. Check that the electricity is moving through the wires. üîå‚ö°Ô∏è. Is the thing {on, live}(?) /‚úÖ/

Why is it so easy to get caught up in processes and tooling in tech and not see the **forest for the trees**?
